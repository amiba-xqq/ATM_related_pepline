Immunofluorescence assay
=============================
ImageJ macro and R scripts were used to quantify the number of foci, foci area, and average fluorescence intensity of DNA repair proteins within nuclei for each cell.

Immunofluorescence images were captured by a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica). Files are in .LIF format, with each LIF file containing multiple sets of images.

All ImageJ macro scripts are only compatible with Windows systems.
