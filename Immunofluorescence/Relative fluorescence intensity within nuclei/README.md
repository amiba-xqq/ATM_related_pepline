# Relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei

ImageJ macro脚本用于统计每个细胞核内荧光蛋白的相对荧光强度，最终得到的csv格式的结果文件，‘IntDen’列就是相对荧光强度值。

`Batch export merged images from LIF files (including DAPI, red, and green channels).ijm`得到的TIFF图片，使用`Relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei (Both red and green channels).ijm`分析foci数目，其它类型的TIFF图片同理。

具体使用流程可以参考`Protocol of Relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei.pptx`。


ImageJ macro scripts are used to calculate the relative fluorescence intensity within each nucleus for proteins. The final CSV file contains the relative fluorescence intensity values in the 'IntDen' column.

Use the `Batch export merged images from LIF files (including DAPI, red, and green channels).ijm` script to generate TIFF images. Then, use the `Relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei (Both red and green channels)` script to analyze relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei in these images. Similar methods apply to other TIFF image types.

For specifics on how to use these scripts, refer to the `Protocol of Relative fluorescence intensity within nuclei.pptx`.
