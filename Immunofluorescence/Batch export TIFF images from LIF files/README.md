Batch export TIFF images from LIF files
=============================
这些ImageJ macro脚本是用于批量处理lif文件，从而导出所有通道合并之后的图片，用于后续分析DNA repair protein foci数目或者细胞核内蛋白的相对荧光强度。

如果荧光图片只含有DAPI和red通道，则使用`Batch export merged images from LIF files (including DAPI and red channels).ijm`，其它同理。

具体使用流程可以参考`Protocol of Batch Processing LIF Files Tutorial.pptx`。

The following ImageJ macro scripts are designed for batch processing of LIF files. They export all-channel merged images, which are 
then used to analyze either the number of DNA repair protein foci or the relative fluorescence intensity of nuclear proteins in 
subsequent steps.

For fluorescent images that only have DAPI and red channels, use the `Batch export merged images from LIF files (including DAPI 
and red channels).ijm` script. Similar steps apply to other cases.

For specifics on how to use these scripts, refer to the `Protocol of Batch Processing LIF Files Tutorial.pptx`.
