Batch export TIFF images from LIF files
=============================
这些ImageJ macro脚本是用于批量处理lif文件，从而导出所有通道合并之后的图片，用于后续分析DNA repair protein foci数目或者细胞核内蛋白的相对荧光强度。

The following ImageJ macro scripts are designed for batch processing of LIF files. They export all-channel merged images, which are 
then used to analyze either the number of DNA repair protein foci or the relative fluorescence intensity of nuclear proteins in 
subsequent steps.
